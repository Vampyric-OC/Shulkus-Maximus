# Shulkus Maximus

!Work-in-progress!

TODO:
- Fix ticket passing bug
- Finish The Book

Examples and structures you can find above or in the [World Download](https://github.com/Vampyric-OC/Shulkus-Maximus/raw/main/Shulkus%20Maximus.zip) zip.
In the world you will find The Book. This is a manual and description of the Shulkus Maximus system and its components.

The Shulkus Maximus system is a storage, automation and signaling system based on minecarts, shulker boxes and a ticket system.
It includes shared front ends for storage and farm input, back ends for item filtering, automatic smelting with super smelters and brewing with a super brewer.

The Creative Front End.
Contains every stackable item in the game in the shulker boxes, sorted in any way you would like.
Dispenser has around 20 more shulkers per module and behind the shulkers there is an shulker recycle hopper to recycle empty or partially emptied shulkers back into the system. Returned shulkers will be completely emptied and refilled.
Button dispenses a new shulker.
<br/><br/>

Back of the Creative Front End.
This shows the rail input with latched ticket switches and consolidation of minecarts to a single output rail.
<br/><br/>

Left, a shulker placer which places a shulker when the placed one is mined.
Right is an alternative, smaller but more manual front end.
Shulker return is done here by directly placing them in the minecart.
The first 3 shulkers of this frontend show the shared nature of the front ends, these are the same as the first 3 of the creative front end.
You can have any number of front end and the system will distribute shulkers among these.
The purple shulkers are filled by different shulker loaders, shown below.
<br/><br/>

![Shulkus Maximus Image #04](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vampyric-OC/Shulkus-Maximus/main/Screenshots/Shulkus_Maximus_04.png)
32 completely over-engineered back end modules for the creative front end.
Each module here has its own 4x hopper speed shulker unloader to keep all shulker boxes in their own front/back end combination.
This allows you to color and rename all shulkers in a certain combination and those shulkers will stay in those modules.
The shulkers are filled by a 2x speed minecart to shulker loader, where the minecart is filled by a 27 long fast (2x speed) item filter.

Things need not be this complex though. As shown below.
<br/><br/>

![Shulkus Maximus Image #05](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vampyric-OC/Shulkus-Maximus/main/Screenshots/Shulkus_Maximus_05.png)
If coloring and renaming shulkers is not needed, then things get a lot easier.
This is a shared 4x speed shulker unloader and potion filter with a minecart queue on the left.
<br/><br/>

![Shulkus Maximus Image #06](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vampyric-OC/Shulkus-Maximus/main/Screenshots/Shulkus_Maximus_06.png)
Empty shulkers can then be filled up with any shulker loader, of which these are a few examples.
The first one is a simple item loader which loads a shulker 1/3s full with bone meal.
You can then route these shulkers to any farm which needs bone meal.
The second is a large storage filter for minable blocks. It uses 10 stacked minecarts per filter as a buffer.
Third we have a filter for potion ingredients and forth is an end filter which will just fill up a shulker with all overflow and unstakable items left over after filtering.
<br/><br/>

![Shulkus Maximus Image #07](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vampyric-OC/Shulkus-Maximus/main/Screenshots/Shulkus_Maximus_07.png)
Three more shulker loaders. These being based on shulker shuffling.
The first one is a full configurable loader which allows packing a shulker to exact stack specifications.
It includes the ability to keep empty slots in the middle too if you would need that.
The other 2 are for an assortment of potions in any order and amount you need.
<br/><br/>

![Shulkus Maximus Image #08](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vampyric-OC/Shulkus-Maximus/main/Screenshots/Shulkus_Maximus_08.png)
The Super Brewer.
This is a fast super brewer which uses potion recipes in shulker boxes to brew 24 potions in around 2  to 3 minutes.
It can also be used without the minecart/ticket system, just feed shulker recipes into the dispenser in the right back and collect the shulker and potions in the hoppers on the left back.
<br/><br/>

![Shulkus Maximus Image #09](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vampyric-OC/Shulkus-Maximus/main/Screenshots/Shulkus_Maximus_09.png)
Ticket Swapper.
This switches the ticket in a minecart with a ticket in a shulker in the 2nd slot.
This allows point to point connections to a common destination.
<br/><br/>

![Shulkus Maximus Image #10](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vampyric-OC/Shulkus-Maximus/main/Screenshots/Shulkus_Maximus_10.png)
With the above swapper we can thus have a super smelter connected to multiple front ends.
Above you see one with the swapper and a minecart queue.
It also automatically smelts wood to charcoal and loads it up.
<br/><br/>

![Shulkus Maximus Image #11](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vampyric-OC/Shulkus-Maximus/main/Screenshots/Shulkus_Maximus_11.png)
Front end for the smelter.
The left is wood input (can of course be connected to an automatic tree farm), right are 2 item in/outputs.
